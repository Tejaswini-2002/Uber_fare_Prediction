# Uber_fare_Prediction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict Uber ride fares. The data used for the project is from Kaggle. 
## Data Cleanup 
The first step in any data analytics project is to analyse the data. This includes cleaning the data, checking for missing values, and visualising the data to identify any patterns or trends. The data cleaning process required that rows with missing values ​​and duplicate values ​​be removed. The data were also tested for outliers. 
## Data Visualization 
The data was visualised using plots. The comments revealed interesting patterns and trends. For example, average fares were higher during peak hours than at other times of the day. Average fares were highest at the beginning of the month. 
## Machine Learning 
The next step in the project was to develop a machine learning model for taxi fares. Machine learning models such as linear regression and random forests were evaluated. The model that worked well was the random forest model. 
## Model evaluation 
Random forest models were tested using absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R-square score MAE are measures of error between predicted and actual values made by performance care standards. The RMSE is a measure of the squared error between the predicted values ​​and the actual values. The R-squared score is a measure of the correlation between predicted values ​​and actual values. The random forest generated an average MAE of $2.01, an average RMSE of $3.45, and an R-squared score of 0.78.
